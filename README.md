My Name is Ankit Kafle and this is my first stuff which i am learning . I know you also came along to look my stuff
I am a boring guy and i am writing this boring stuff here and the amazing thing is that you are giving your valuable time for my this stuff ok! well dont go now
You came here along to see this stuff but this stuff in not almost all stuff i will give you some valuable thing at last
I know doing duty is the best thing and there is a saying "Those Who are dutyful are very Beautyful" but there is another duty in life also and that is spirituality.
If you are only doing this material world duty doesnot make you and take you to the inner peace,blissfullness and happy. 
You should try to understand your real nature of soul and the lovingly relationship between soul and God which have been cover by the darkness of our ignorance.
so the best solutiom is that always chant his name, whatever the religion you are in try to love GOD. No one love and care you more than him, everything is manifesting from the God
Believe in The God,Trust him and dont think that loving god means to getting the luxurious life, No that is misconception.
Whatever situation you are in your life either luxuriou or non luxurious it doesnot matter, the thing matters only is that how much you are happy and remembering him in your life
And that pure nector of happiness comes only when you have the loving relationship with god with zero egoness,jelousness and selfishness
Do your prescribe duty with all your best performance with full confidence and sincerity as well as dont forget god also. 
At last be sincere,chant the name of god, while seeing fault and criticizing other first of all see fault on you. GO WITH THIS SUCCESS(HAPPINESS) COMES AUTOMATICALLY
